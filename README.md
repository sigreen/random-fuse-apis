REST and SOAP services using Fuse and SpringBoot
===========================


This project contains a set of use cases demonstrating REST and SOAP services using Fuse and SpringBoot.

In this project, Fuse performs SOAP Orchestration and connects to multiple systems like RDBMS databases and JMS brokers. 

The overarching demo will highlight service decomposition within Fuse, with the API secured and proxied by 3scale.


See the use cases for [code-first REST](./codefirst-rest-service), [code-first SOAP](./codefirst-soap-service) and [contract-first SOAP](./contractfirst-soap-service).
